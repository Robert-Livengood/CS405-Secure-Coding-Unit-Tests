# Unit-Test-Examples
Assignment from CS405 demonstrating my ability to write relevant JUnit tests. There are several positive tests and 2 failed tests to show JUnit testing functionality. The last test also includes a binary search alogorithm to provide an example of a Computer Science algorithm. Below is a screenshot of the binary search algorithm and the unit test results.

Unit test results
**NOTE:**
There are two tests intentionally resulting in failure to demostrate functionality.
